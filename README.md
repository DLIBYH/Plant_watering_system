# IoT-based-Smart-Plant-Watering-System

# Project Objectives: 
The main objective of this project is to build a smart plant watering device which can be used to water dried up plants via internet. The plant watering device that we build can be controlled remotely from any part of the world over internet.

# Description of Project: 
An IoT-based smart plant watering system is designed to automate the process of watering plants and to ensure that plants receive the right amount of water at the right time. This system uses sensors to detect the moisture level of the soil and sends the data to a cloud-based server for analysis. Based on the analysis performed by the server, the system is programmed to water the plants.

The key components of an IoT-based plant watering system include a soil moisture sensor, a water-pump, a relay-module, and a Wi-Fi or Bluetooth module. The soil moisture sensor measures the level of moisture in the soil and sends the data to the relay-module for processing. The relay-module then triggers the water-pump to release water in the soil, based on the programmed guidelines. Moreover, this system can be controlled through mobile applications installed on smartphones, enabling the users to monitor the status of the plants remotely and control the watering of the plants as well. Overall, an IoT-based plant watering system can help to conserve water, improve plant health, reduce water waste, and promote efficiency in plant care.


# Motivation: 
The motivation for developing smart systems for garden care comes from a desire to enhance convenience, ensure consistent care, and improve resource management. In the case of plant care, convenience is key, especially in today’s fast-paced world where time is precious. The primary objective of this project is to create a smart plant watering system that can be controlled remotely via the internet. This system is designed to integrate with various types of plants and ensure they receive the right amount of water at the right time, no matter where you are. By allowing remote monitoring and control, this smart watering system ensures your plants thrive even when you're away.
