# IoT-based-Smart-Plant-Watering-System

# Project Objectives: 
The main objective of this project is to build a smart plant watering device which can be used to water dried up plants via internet. The plant watering device that we build can be controlled remotely from any part of the world over internet.

# Description of Project: 
This Smart Plant Watering system is fully controlled via the internet. It can be operated from Android/iOS devices using an IoT-based dedicated app, Blynk. A feature in the app displaying the soil moisture level allows you to monitor the moisture of the soil working as an indicator to water your plants, ensuring they receive the right amount of moisture at the right times. You can manage your plant watering from anywhere in the world, turning the system on or off using the Blynk app. The dedicated app offers seamless control, making it easy to get used to the intuitive interface. With just a single tap, you can start or stop watering your plants, and the response time is exceptionally fast. Whether you're at home or away, your plants will be well-cared for, ensuring they stay healthy and thriving.

# Motivation: 
The motivation for developing smart systems for garden care comes from a desire to enhance convenience, ensure consistent care, and improve resource management. In the case of plant care, convenience is key, especially in today’s fast-paced world where time is precious. The primary objective of this project is to create a smart plant watering system that can be controlled remotely via the internet. This system is designed to integrate with various types of plants and ensure they receive the right amount of water at the right time, no matter where you are. By allowing remote monitoring and control, this smart watering system ensures your plants thrive even when you're away.
